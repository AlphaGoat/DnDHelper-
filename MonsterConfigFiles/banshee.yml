    as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends

    DESC: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the banshee that can see her
      must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A
      frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending the effect
      on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is succesful or the effects
      end for it, the target is immune to the banshee's Horrifying Visage for the
