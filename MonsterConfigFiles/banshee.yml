  Detect Life: The banshee can magically sense the presence of living creatures up
    to 5 miles away. She knows the general direction they're in but not their exact
    locations.
  Incorporeal Movement: The  banshee can move through other creatures and objects
    as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends
    her turn inside an object

    DESC: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the banshee that can see her
      must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A
      frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
      with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending the effect
      on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is succesful or the effects
      end for it, the target is immune to the banshee's Horrifying Visage for the
      next 24 hours.
